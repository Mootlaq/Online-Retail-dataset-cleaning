# Online-Retail-dataset-cleaning

I was messing with the Online Retail || dataset for analysis purposes but as I was finishing cleaning the dataset (which took a good amount of time!), I realized that this might be a good opportunity to show why data cleaning takes a huge portion of the data scientist's time. One step in this project took me about 3-4 hours and at the end, I found that no action was needed! the last part was both frustrating and satisfying! so I thought I would share my experience. 

[Here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II) is a link of the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It provides a good documentation of the dataset. I also provided the csv file of the post-cleaning dataset.

** The post is in the *Data Cleaning* folder.**
